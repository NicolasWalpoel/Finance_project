# Finance_project
Personal python project to put in practice my theoretical knowledge in quantitative finance.

Using the yfinance lib, I've first computed ad visionlike trading dashboard with various metrics for short and long term trading. 
We then use this metrics to create portfolios strategies with daily trades. One can easily enhance those strategies using the functions that I've deevlopped and have a rapid feedback on the performances.

The second part of this project focuses on options. I've used Monte Carlo methods and the Black et Scholes model in order to calculate options prices and grecks.
