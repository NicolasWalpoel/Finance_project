# Finance_project
Personal python project to put in practice my theoretical knowledge in quantitative finance.

Using the yfinance lib, I've first computed ad dashboard with various metrics for short and long term traing.

The second part of this project focuses on options. I've used Monte Carlo methods and the Black et Scholes model in order to calculate options prices and grecks.
